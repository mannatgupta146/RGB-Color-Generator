# RGB Color Generator

**Having trouble choosing the right color?** Here's the solution: Adjust each RGB slider carefully while monitoring the real-time color preview. This will help you see how each color component (Red, Green, Blue) affects the final result. The real-time preview makes it easier to experiment and find the perfect color shade.

## Description 

The **RGB Color Generator** is an interactive web application that allows users to generate any color by adjusting the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values using sliders. As the sliders are moved, the selected color is displayed in real-time. This simple tool makes it easy for designers, developers, or anyone interested in color creation to explore different shades.
